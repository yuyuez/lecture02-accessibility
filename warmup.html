  <h1>Cute Things</h1>

  <!-- 
    Below is a "descriptive list" (dl). This is like an unordered list (ul), 
    except it contains pairs of terms (dt) and descriptions (dd)---sort of 
    like a dictionary.
  
    1. Add a new entry to the below list giving and describing something you
    think is cute! You'll need to include both a (dt) and (dd) elements

    2. Add a second new entry whose term is "This Panda" and whose description
    is an img tag with src "http://bit.ly/1MadBtw" (you can also pick your own
    image!) Be sure to include an alt attribute!
  -->

    <dd>Baby dogs are pretty adorable</dd>

    <dt class="favorite">Kitties</dt>
